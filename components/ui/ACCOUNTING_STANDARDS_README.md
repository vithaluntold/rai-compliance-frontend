# Accounting Standards UI Components

I've created a comprehensive set of UI components to display accounting standards in an organized, professional manner that follows the RAi brand guidelines.

## Components Created

### 1. `accounting-standards-display.tsx`
A full-featured, flexible component with:
- **Grid layout** (responsive: 1-3 columns)
- **Compact list view** option
- **Selection capabilities** with visual feedback
- **Category-based color coding** (Core, Industry-Specific, Specialized)
- **Customizable** title, description, and data

**Usage:**
```tsx
import AccountingStandardsDisplay from '@/components/ui/accounting-standards-display';

<AccountingStandardsDisplay
  standards={yourStandards}
  title="Custom Title"
  selectable={true}
  onStandardSelect={handleSelection}
  compact={false}
/>
```

### 2. `real-estate-accounting-standards.tsx`
A ready-to-use component specifically for the 9 real estate accounting standards:
- **Pre-configured** with your exact standards data
- **Professional layout** with category legend
- **Summary statistics** display
- **Hover effects** and animations
- **RAi brand colors** throughout

**Usage:**
```tsx
import RealEstateAccountingStandards from '@/components/ui/real-estate-accounting-standards';

<RealEstateAccountingStandards />
```

### 3. `compact-accounting-standards.tsx`
A space-efficient version perfect for sidebars or chat interfaces:
- **Vertical list layout**
- **Scrollable** with configurable height
- **Compact design** with essential information
- **Optional header**

**Usage:**
```tsx
import CompactAccountingStandards from '@/components/ui/compact-accounting-standards';

<CompactAccountingStandards maxHeight="400px" showHeader={true} />
```

### 4. `accounting-standards-demo.tsx`
A comprehensive demo page showcasing all features:
- **Interactive controls** for testing different modes
- **Multiple examples** showing various use cases

## Standards Included

The components include these 9 accounting standards:

- **IAS 1** - Presentation of Financial Statements (Core)
- **IAS 7** - Statement of Cash Flows (Core)  
- **IFRS 15** - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Industry-Specific)

## Integration

To integrate any of these components into your existing pages:

1. Import the desired component

3. Customize with props as needed
4. The components will automatically use RAi brand styling

The components are built with the existing design system and will integrate seamlessly with your current UI.
